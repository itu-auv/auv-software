# Global Costmap Parameters (inherits from mbf_costmap_common_params.yaml)

global_costmap:
  # Inherit common parameters
  global_frame: odom       # Should match common params
  robot_base_frame: base_link # Should match common params
  update_frequency: 1.0     # Lower frequency for global map is often acceptable
  publish_frequency: 0.5    # Lower frequency for global map is often acceptable
  transform_tolerance: 1.0  # Can be higher for global map

  # Static map layer (if used)
  # static_map: true # Enable if using a map_server

  # Dimensions (adjust based on expected operational area)
  width: 30.0  # meters
  height: 30.0 # meters
  resolution: 0.1 # meters/pixel, should match common params if using voxel

  # Layers - Specify which layers from common params to use, or define new ones
  plugins:
    # - {name: static_layer, type: "costmap_2d::StaticLayer"} # Uncomment if using static map
    # - {name: obstacle_layer, type: "costmap_2d::VoxelLayer"} # Example using VoxelLayer
    - {name: inflation_layer, type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"}
